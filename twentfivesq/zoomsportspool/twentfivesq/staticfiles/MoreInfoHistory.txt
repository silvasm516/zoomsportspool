<h2>ZOOMSPORTSPOOL<H2>
<h3><strong>Early History And Beginnings</strong></h3>
<h4><p id = "mz" style= "font-family: arial, font-size: 16px;">Zoomsportspool began in 2011, when someone asked me if I could suggest a spreadsheet 
solution to a football pool that they were putting together for the Superbowl. I was known 
to my friends as something of a "spreadsheet-geek", having constructed a Sudoku-Solver spreadsheet
utilizing Knuth's algorithym, and written almost entirely in visual basic code, the previous 
summer. So, I suppose I was "volunteered" to tackle the project based on those credentials. 
It wouldn't have to be anything too complicated. Something that, could operate as a normal Excel
spreadsheet. Be shared by office workers, who after submitting their choice of squares, would 
then in turn, pass along the file to another worker's computer, who would also select squares, 
and so on. Finally, the office worker charged with running the pool, would have some automated 
means of randomly assigning row/column numbers, and then everyone could be furnished a print-out 
before the game. And that would be that. The result of this task, was Football Squares Pool Manager 
-Office Edition.</p></h4>
